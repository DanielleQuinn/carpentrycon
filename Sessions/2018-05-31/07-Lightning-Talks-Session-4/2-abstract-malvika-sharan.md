## Abstract

The German Network for Bioinformatics Infrastructure (de.NBI) is a national network funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research. de.NBI provides bioinformatics services to life-science and biomedicine researchers, constituting at the same time the German ELIXIR node. Through one of its service centers, the Heidelberg Center for Human Bioinformatics (HD-HuB), we host a variety of bio-computational resources and offer courses and training opportunities to scientists in a wide range of topics. Additionally, we organize events that provide a platform to assist researchers in the Heidelberg area to network with each other and exchange their knowledge. HD-HuB unites the bioinformatics expertise of three distinguished research institutions: the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), and Heidelberg University, and facilitates an environment for establishing an effective and efficient bioinformatics community in Heidelberg. EMBL Heidelberg provides a local bioinformatics support platform, Bio-IT, to their ~600 life-scientists across >50 groups. EMBL has reported a consistent increase in the fraction of scientists who devote >=50% of their time to computational-based research, seeing a growth from 39% to 46% between 2009 and 2015. Bio-IT is an initiative established to support the development and technical capability of this diverse bio-computational community. The community has grown organically to tackle challenges together, providing training and support for scientific computing, creating and maintaining tools and resources for reproducible science, and providing opportunities for discussion and collaboration. Here, we share some lessons learned while establishing these communities and discuss the efforts required to maintain it thereafter.
