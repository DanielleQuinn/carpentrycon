## Abstract
There is broad Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) recognition of the growing software challenges that the Exascale Computing Project community in the United States face. The broader software community has developed important platforms and tools as well as methodologies such that are improving software quality and sustainability. The Interoperable Design of Extreme-scale Application Software - Exascale Computing Project (IDEAS-ECP) will leverage the Software Carpentry Foundation to provide instruction in software fundamentals for researchers. Software Carpentry is one of the first organizations to recognize the ubiquity of computing in scientific fields and the necessity of basic computing skills for researchers. The IDEAS-ECP team is pursuing multifaceted collaborations with the Department of Energy (DOE) computing facilities and the ECP community on training and outreach as well as working toward coordinated tutorials and software deployment. This poster session will highlight the training activities and needs, including the tutorials and SWC training we have already provided and future needs we envision for ECP.
