## Abstract
Popper[<sup>1</sup>](http://falsifiable.us)[<sup>2</sup>](https://github.com/systemslab/popper) is an NSF- and CROSS-sponsored[<sup>3</sup>](https://cross.ucsc.edu)[<sup>4</sup>](http://bigweatherweb.org) convention and CLI tool for conducting experiments and writing academic articles following best software engineering and DevOps practices. Popper organizes artifacts associated to scientific explorations inside a code repository such as Git. These "popperized" repositories[<sup>5</sup>](https://github.com/popperized) are self-contained and easily shareable so that others can replicate and extend existing work. We have a draft Carpentry-formatted lesson on Popper[<sup>6</sup>](https://ivotron.github.io/popper-lesson/) that we want to eventually propose to be included in the official software carpentry curriculum. We are also working closely with computational/data scientists of the Exascale Project[<sup>7</sup>](https://www.exascaleproject.org/) in the context of the 2018 BSSw fellowship[<sup>8</sup>](https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/02/bssw-fellow.html)[<sup>9</sup>](https://bssw.io/blog_posts/introducing-the-2018-bssw-fellows). In this talk and poster, we will introduce Popper, show a demo of the CLI tool and briefly walk through our draft version of the Carpentry-formatted lesson.
