## Abstract
We report our experience in a Brazilian Workshop of Python for Biological Data (BWPBD) in 2017. This work involved i) selection of members for organizing committee and participants ii) establishment of the institutional support; iii) event broadcast and communication with participants iv) data selection, management, and preparation; v) development of practical sessions with Python programming and Jupyter notebook including also lectures from invited speakers, vi) workshop evaluation through main feedback from participants (Google Form). The organizing committee comprised graduate and undergraduate students in the fields of biology and computer science. We selected 17 participants from several universities in São Paulo State, favoring students without any background in computer science or programming skills, and involved in projects with data manipulation. Main drawbacks were: intermittent problems with internet WiFi connection, short time to provide deep demonstration of applications of programming to solve biological problems; and few post-workshop interactions of the students.
